This this challenge given by CoinedOne.

Features I have used in this challenge are listed below:
1. shared preference
2. Accessibility Service
3. Time Picker

Note:
The Main aim of the challenge is to "restrict browser(chrome) from not loading certain websites for a particular time period". I tried it using accessibility services and it worked fine in the Emulator, but when I tested in Real devices It failed to work. I have attached a link to the video of the application working fine in Emulator.
